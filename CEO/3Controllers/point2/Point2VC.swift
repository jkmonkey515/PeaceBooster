Point 2 has revealed that this person did not self-produce because she lacks individual nature of any kind that could; instead this person is a manifestation of the universal nature and its countless and ever-changing physical and non-physical elements.\n Thus, she is not different from you or anybody, and vice versa, as everyone is a product of the same universal nature and not their own.\n This understanding challenges the notion of individual existence and highlights the universal origin and essence we all share.\n By grasping this fact, youâ€™ve paved the way for deeper insights into the nature of existence most people remain unaware of.\nCongratulations! You have completed Step #2!",
